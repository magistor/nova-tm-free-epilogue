!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

Around fifteen hundred years ago, the lands were riddled with heretics, worshippers of Shilen, the goddess of death… Anakim, an angel of Einhazad, came down from the skies, surrounded by sacred flames and three pairs of wings. Thus empowered, the Emperor launched a war against “Shilen’s people”. The emperor’s army led by Anakim attacked “Shilen’s people” relentlessly, but in the end some survivors managed to hide in underground Catacombs. A new leader emerged, Lilith, who seeked to summon Shilen from the afterlife and to rebuild the Lilim army within the eight Necropolises. Now, in the midst of impending war, the merchant of Mammon struck a deal. He supplies Shunaiman with war funds in exchange for protection. And right now the document we’re looking for is that contract.
