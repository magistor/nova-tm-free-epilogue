!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

We do – the Priests of Dusk hold the page. One of our spies was able to find the document, but was discovered and killed before we could spirit him away.

I want you to go in his place, infiltrate the Priests of Dusk and steal the last page of that contract. We’ll train you up first, or rather Agent Collin will.

You’ll find him at Oren’s south entrance. Take him this note else he’ll tell you little more that the time of the day.
